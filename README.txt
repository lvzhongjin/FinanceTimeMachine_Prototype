Goal: Develop a Shiny FinApp to showcase a new investment strategy and collect clients' feedback. 

Currenver version: a prototype time machine that takes you back to a point of time in the past and helps you to inspect how various decisions shape your financial status today. This special version focuses on people living in NYC with kids. 

The github version is for illustration purpose. For the complete version including more features, better graphicas, raw data and data processing codes you can contact me via lvzhongjin@gmail.com.
